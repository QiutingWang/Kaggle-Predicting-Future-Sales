Note that the list of shops and products changes every month. \n","This notebook contains general information about the methods using which you can approach the problem statement.\n","\n","Lets first discuss what we are given and what we have to predict.

ID - unique for every (shop_id,item_id) pair.\n","2. shop_id - unique number of every shop\n","3. item_id - unique number of every item\n","\n","Daily historical sales are given *from Jan 2013 to Oct 2015*.
